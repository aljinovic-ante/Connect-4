# Connect 4
Connect 4 game in C++

The game can be launched either via the 'Connect4' shortcut or by adding the necessary files in Visual Studio.

Possible improvements:
  Visual appearance of the game => adding colors for easier recognition of the signs.
  PC AI => Currently, the game's AI operates based on recognizing 'threats' and 'opportunities', but it does not have a developed strategy for its own gameplay.
